Spin up an on-demand self-hosted GitHub action runner on any Unix like operating system.

### Environment Variables

- **ARTIFACT_VERSION** - Runner version. Uses the latest version from [actions/runner].
- **ACTIONS_DIR** - Directory where the runner has to be downloaded and configured. Uses the current working directory.
- **GIT_TOKEN** - Required for authentication to add runners.
- **GIT_OWNER** - GitHub account username [OR] organization name.
- **GIT_REPOSITORY** - Repository name _(required to create runners dedicated to a particular repo)_
- **RUNNER_GROUP** - Runner group. Uses `default`
- **RUNNER_NAME** - Runner name. Uses a random instance ID.
- **WORK_DIR** - Work directory. Uses `_work`
- **LABELS** - Runner labels (comma separated). Uses `"docker-node,${os_name}-${architecture}"`
- **REUSE_EXISTING** - Re-use existing configuration. Defaults to `false`

> [!NOTE]
> 
> `REUSE_EXISTING` flag can be useful when a container restarts due to an issue or
> when a container is reused after being terminated without shutting down gracefully.

> <summary><strong>More info</strong></summary>
>
> Following files/directories are created (commonly across `macOS`, `Linux` and `Windows` runners)
> only when the runner has been configured 
> - `_work`
> - `_diag`
> - `.runner`
> - `.credentials`
> - `.credentials_rsaparams`
>
> So, a simple check on one or more of these files' presence should confirm if the runner has been configured already
>
> **Note:** Warnings like the ones below are common, and GitHub typically reconnects the runner automatically.
> ```text
> A session for this runner already exists.
> ```
> ```
> Runner connect error: The actions runner i-058175xh7908r2u46 already has an active session.. Retrying until reconnected.
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Using this image **without** the env var `GIT_REPOSITORY` will create an organization level runner.<br>
> Using self-hosted runners in public repositories pose some considerable security threats.

<summary><strong>Env vars for notifications</strong></summary>

> This project supports [ntfy] and [telegram bot] for startup/shutdown notifications.

**NTFY**

Choose ntfy setup instructions with [basic][ntfy-setup-basic] **OR** [authentication][ntfy-setup-auth] abilities

- **NTFY_URL** - Ntfy endpoint for notifications.
- **NTFY_TOPIC** - Topic to which the notifications have to be sent.
- **NTFY_USERNAME** - Ntfy username for authentication _(if topic is protected)_
- **NTFY_PASSWORD** - Ntfy password for authentication _(if topic is protected)_

**Telegram**

Steps for telegram bot configuration

1. Use [BotFather] to create a telegram bot token
2. Send a test message to the Telegram bot you created
3. Use the URL https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/getUpdates to get the Chat ID
   - You can also use Thread ID to send notifications to a particular thread within a group

```shell
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
export CHAT_ID=$(curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates" | jq -r '.result[0].message.chat.id')
```

- **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN** - Telegram Bot token
- **TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID** - Chat ID to which the notifications have to be sent.
- **THREAD_ID** - Optional thread ID to send notifications to a specific thread.

> **Note:** To send notifications to threads, the bot should be added to a group with [Topics][telegram-topics] enabled.<br>
> Send a message to the bot in a group thread
> ```shell
> export THREAD_ID=$(curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates" | jq -r '.result[0]|.update_id')
> ```
